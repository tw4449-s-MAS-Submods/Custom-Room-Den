# Custom-Room-Den 
This submod adds a cozy green-walled den where you can relax with Monika.

#### Hi! First of all: thank you for wanting to use my work! It means a lot that I can do something to make people's time with their Monika that much better.

#### Anyhow, right to the instructions.

## Instructions:

1. Go to the "Releases" tab on the right this webpage(or click [HERE](https://github.com/tw4449-s-MAS-Submods/Custom-Room-Den/releases)), then click on the latest version of "Custom Room Den". To download click on Source code (zip) to begin.

2. Unzip and open the folder called 'Custom-Room-Den' (it should be in your 'Downloads' folder).

3. From the Custom-Room-Den folder, copy the 'game' and 'lib' folders into the main
   'Doki Doki Literature Club' folder (AKA, the folder where you see 'DDLC.exe').
   
4. If you have 400+ affection: Launch MAS, and the room will be available. Monika will explain how to use it after a minute or so. If you have less than 400 affection: Launch MAS, and Monika should comment you added it, but you can't use it just yet. Once you reach 400 affection, you can find the room under "Hey, Monika..." > "Location" > "Can we go somewhere else?".

And that's it! It's that simple.


## Other rooms

I have other rooms available! They can be found here:

-[Spaceroom v1](https://github.com/tw4449-s-MAS-Submods/Custom-Room-Furnished-Spaceroom-V1)

-[Spaceroom v2](https://github.com/tw4449-s-MAS-Submods/Custom-Room-Furnished-Spaceroom-V2)

-[Spaceroom v3](https://github.com/tw4449-s-MAS-Submods/Custom-Room-Furnished-Spaceroom-V3)

-[Spaceroom v4](https://github.com/tw4449-s-MAS-Submods/Custom-Room-Furnished-Spaceroom-V4)

-[Kitchen](https://github.com/tw4449-s-MAS-Submods/Custom-Room-Kitchen)

-[Garden-View](https://github.com/tw4449-s-MAS-Submods/Custom-Room-Garden-View)

## Troubleshooting:

-If the room doesn't show up or if you get an error, most likely the files weren't placed correctly. Repeat
   step 3, making sure to put the "game" and "lib" folders directly into the main "Doki Doki Literature Club"
   folder.
   
-Alternately, if the room hasn't shown up but Monika commented on it, you may not have 400 affection. You can check your 
   affection level in your files at: 'Doki Doki Literature Club'>'log'>'aff_log.txt'
   
-If the problem persists, there may another issue with your install of MAS. Go to the "issues" tab on this
   webpage and see if anyone else has had the same issue, and try any solutions posted there. If not, leave a
   description of your problem, and I'll see what I can do.


## Other info:

-The game will notify you when an update to the submod is available, thanks to submod plugin we
   incorporated courtesy of Booplicate (more info below). This plugin both notifies you of updates, and helps
   you download and install them.

## Updating

Speaking of updates, if you get a notification that an update is available, go to the "Submods" tab in your menu in MAS
(hit "Esc" to bring the menu up). In the Submods page, find the name "Submod Updater Plugnin" you'll see a prompt to update your submods. It will
guide you through the rest.

## Acknowledgments:

This submod was truly a group effort, with
[cdino11](https://github.com/cdino11), [multimokia](https://github.com/multimokia), [d3adpan](https://github.com/d3adpan), and [robTTm](https://github.com/robTTM) handling the coding. It *literally* couldn't have happened without them.

Additionally, many kudos and thanks to [Booplicate](https://github.com/Booplicate) for allowing us to incorporate his submod updater plugin (its main repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-SubmodUpdaterPlugin)). It's an amazing feature and tool for submod creators.

#### Thanks again for downloading our submod, and I hope you enjoy your time with Monika in your new furnished room!

#### ~ tw4449
